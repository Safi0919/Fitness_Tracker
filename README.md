### Installation

Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Safi0919/Fitness_Tracker
  ```

To run WorkMan on your local machine, open a code editor and open 2 command lines simultaneously

On the first terminal, run the following commands:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
Your backend should be running now, and you should get a message stating, "Backend successfully started!"
